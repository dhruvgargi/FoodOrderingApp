# FoodiesJunction : Food Ordering App
Capstone Project: FoodOrderingApp - Back-end module

In this project, you will be developing from scratch REST API endpoints of various functionalities required for the web app FoodOrderingApp.  In order to observe the functionality of the endpoints, you will use the Swagger user interface and 
store the data in the PostgreSQL database. Also, the project has to be implemented using Java Persistence API (JPA).

As you are already aware, this is a group project; so, you will be required to use GitHub to conduct version control of 
your backend project.

In your submission, include a link to your GitHub repo that contains the backend of FoodOrderingApp.
